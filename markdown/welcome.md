> “Everybody in this Country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think.” - Steve Jobs

I am a Software Developer, with a Bachelors of Computer Science from the Rochester Institute of Technology, and have been programming since my freshman year of high school.  I currently work in the aerospace industry doing avionics and DevOps work.  This website is meant as a way to show the world what I am working on and hopefully how, like Job’s said, coding can teach one how to think.


## About me:

Here is a little bit about me...  

I stared coding when I was a junior in high school when a mentor and friend introduced me to the Lua programming language, as well as the Corona SDK framework for mobile applications.  He taught me about basic variables, data structures, logic flow, and a number of other topics during our sessions.  It was shortly after being introduced to programming that I knew it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  Senior year came around and I chose the Rochester Institute of Technology to hone that craft.

It was there that I became heavily involved with a student-faculty research organization called RIT Space Exploration, or SPEX for short.  The goal of SPEX was to give students practical experience so that they were more marketable to aerospace companies when pursueing full time jobs or internships/co-op opportunities.  This group really shaped everything about my professional trajectory and set me up on a somewhat unique path from my peers (Will get to that later).  

I think I resonated with this group because as a young kid I had a fascination with space and wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up.  I mean who doesn't!?!  Seeing Han Solo galavanting around the galaxy, in a trash can for a spaceship, has that effect on a kid. In high school, however, I was not presented with any opportunities to pursue this interest and it died off.  We had design technology class, where I could occaissionally write some code for a project, but certainly nothing space related.  I had a number of friends and mentors that were strong engineers, but none in the aerospace industry.

When coming to RIT and interacting with the sudents, most other kids in my freshman orientation class joined the "cool" computer science clubs like Society of Sofware Engineers, Computer Science House, or AI club.  I gave some of them a shot but did not really fit in with any of these groups in terms of culture.  Most kids wanted to work at the coolest startups, the ones with the newest tech stack, or get in with "The Big Four" (List off the big name unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley and you will eventually hit all of them).  To be clear there is nothing wrong with this but just didn't feel right for me.  It wasn't until I joined SPEX that I truly knew what I wanted to do with my life...
