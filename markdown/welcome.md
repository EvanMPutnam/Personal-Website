# Welcome!  Glad you are here :)

> “Everybody in this Country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think.” - Steve Jobs

I am a Software Developer, with a Bachelors of Computer Science from the Rochester Institute of Technology, and have been programming since my freshman year of high school.  I currently work in the aerospace industry doing avionics and DevOps work.  This website is meant as a way to show the world what I am working on and hopefully how, like Job’s said, coding can teach one how to think.


# About me:

Here is a little bit about me...  

I stared coding when I was a junior in high school when a mentor and friend introduced me to the Lua programming language, as well as the Corona SDK framework for mobile applications.  He taught me about basic variables, data structures, logic flow, and a number of other topics during our sessions.  It was shortly after being introduced to programming that I knew it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  Senior year came around and I chose the Rochester Institute of Technology to hone that craft.

When coming to RIT and interacting with the sudents, most other kids in my freshman orientation class joined the "cool" computer science clubs like Society of Sofware Engineers, Computer Science House, or AI club.  I gave some of them a shot but did not really fit in with any of these groups in terms of culture.  Most kids wanted to work at the coolest startups, the ones with the newest tech stack, or get in with "The Big Four" (List off the big name unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley and you will eventually hit all of them).  To be clear there is nothing wrong with this but just was not the right fit for me.  However, I did find a place that was truly special.

I became heavily involved with a multidiciplany student-faculty research organization called RIT Space Exploration, or SPEX for short.  The goal of SPEX was to give students practical experience with space technology so that they were more marketable to aerospace companies when pursueing full time jobs or internships/co-op opportunities.  I think I resonated with this group because as a young kid I had a fascination with space, and wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up.  I mean who doesn't!?!  Seeing Han Solo galavanting around the galaxy, in a trash can for a spaceship, has that effect on a kid.  

On my first meeting I was convinced to lead a communication sub-system team for a small cube satellite CSLI proposal.  I knew nothing about radios, satellites, or even much of anything about engineering at that point in time.  It was certainly a trial by fire as a freshman but my team members and the SPEX admin team really helped me out a lot.  Eventually, and after a lot of time spent reading, things clicked and I would get my HAM radio license and become pretty good with digital communications.  Our team did everything that was required for the project but I quickly realized that communications was not an area I wanted to continue in.  Then within SPEX I would move on to studying astrophysics and astronomy, satellite construction, and avionics.  Sometimes I led other project teams and eventually became director of the group my senior year.  You will likely hear all about some of the projects I have done in future posts.

## Employment:

Because of RIT Space Exploration and the valuable experience they gave me I was able to earn a co-op at Rockwell Collins, which later merged with UTC Aerospace to form Collins Aerospace, doing avionics work on military airplanes.  It was very exciting and I have been with them co-oping, part time in school, for the past several years.  Prior to that I interned at Guardian Life Insurance doing enterprise web development.
